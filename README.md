# Python-Terminal

Its a Python Script that is focused to work like the typical windows cmd.exe

The Commands are platform unfocused but its made on Windows and for Windows 
so some commands might not work on Linux etc.

I want to try to keep everything in one big script

I will try to make the code better and update it so all Versions will be
listed in the folder
